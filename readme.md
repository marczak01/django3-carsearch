Project title: ''CarSearch''

Project is made by me and my friend. This project is made for learning purposes and we're planning to make only few improvements. But we're not planning to focus on it.
We have a bunch of different solo and co-op projects & ideas on which we're going to spend much more time.

About the project:

It is a web application for people who want to sell or buy cars. 


You can do things like:

- create an account,
- edit or delete your profile and account information,
- reset your password using e-mail verification
- create, edit and delete adverts,
- check other people accounts and their adverts or public informations,
- find your dream car using options like; search, filter or sort objects,
- contact with seller by different options like; e-mail, phone number or build in contact form

This app was created as our first bigger project and to check if we can team work fine remotly.
